This gets the top slot side looking a lot better

Now focusing on Top hole side
L7ShTum130 gets a large number of hits on track and significant improve to neg track chi2 in top

shift stereo sensor du in bottom to move x hits so x at ecal is shifted by 5 mm

use physics run 14770 and do kf based momentum constraint freeing L5 and L6 top sensors in Tu and Rw

use physics run 14770 and do kf based momentum constraint freeing L6 tu and L7 turw top slot sensors

use fee skim of run 14770 and do kf based momentum constraint free L5 6 7 tu top slot sensors

use fee skim of run 14770, remove layer 7 top hits, and do kf based momentum constraint free L5 6 tu top slot/hole sensors and L6 top slot rw
