			 Truth handler drivers load truth information from the input SLIC file
			 and pass them off to the readout data manager, where they may be
			 accessed by other readout drivers.
			 
			 It is required that these drivers specify the name of the collection
			 that they manage, and be of the appropriate handler type that matches
			 the object type of the collection. They may also, optionally, specify
			 whether the truth collection managed by the driver should be output
			 into the readout file, and if so, over what time range.
			 
			 By default, SLIC truth data is not written out. If no output window is
			 specified, and truth is written, the output window will be derived
			 from the readout window and trigger offset parameters of the readout
			 data manager.
			 
			 In general, calorimeter truth information (and the related particles
			 data) are best handled by including truth readout in the calorimeter
			 simulation. This will automatically include all calorimeter truth hits
			 and related MC particles in the readout file.

			 The calorimeter readout driver handles conversion of SLIC truth
			 hits into voltage pulses and ultimately into ADC counts every 4 ns
			 sample. These samples are then integrated and output as hits which
			 are used internally by the readout simulation in the collection
			 set by variable "outputHitCollectionName".
			 
			 When a trigger occurs, the ADC buffer is used to generate readout
			 hits. The exact form these take differs based on the mode that is
			 simulated, but they are always output to the collection defined by
			 variable "readoutHitCollectionName".
			 
			 If truth information is enabled, then a set of truth relations are
			 output as well that link each readout hit to all of the truth hits
			 that are associated with it. Additionally, all truth hits as well
			 as the particle (and its parents) that generated that truth hit
			 are written out to ensure that they are available post-readout.
			 The additional truth information is automatically written to the
			 same collection name as the input truth data. If a truth handler
			 driver also outputs data into this collection, the two will merge.
