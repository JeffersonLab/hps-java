INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE ET TEST SCRIPTS
--------------------------------------------

There are test scripts provided for running the ET example apps on Linux or OSX.  

You will need to start by building this package using Maven.

    mvn clean install

Then, to test the ET server, a producer, and the graphical monitoring, start by opening three different shells and 'cd' into hps-et-java (this directory).

Each of the following commands should be executed from the hps-et-java directory, within its own shell...

To start the server:

    ./scripts/et_server_test.sh

To start the producer which puts test events onto the ET Ring:

    ./scripts/et_producer_test.sh

Finally, to monitor the ET system using a Java GUI program:

    ./scripts/et_monitor_gui_test.sh

In the now open GUI, select "Connections" -> "Connect to ET System".  Under the "ET Name" field put "ETBuffer" (no quotes).  Now hit the "Connect" button.

Under "View" -> "Load Connection Parameters", select the "ETBuffer" session.

A tab called "ETBuffer" will now be created in the GUI where the ET system can be monitored in real time.  Click on the tab to switch to it.

You can also run the command-line monitoring program, but it seems to disconnect from the ET server rather quickly:

    ./scripts/et_monitor_test.sh
